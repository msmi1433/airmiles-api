# Air Miles Data Seed

This project seeds a PSQL DB with data regarding the amount of air miles/points required to travel to destinations from London.

The database will be used to create an API and frontend where users can enter the amount of points they have with a given airline, and receive guidance on where they could travel to using those air miles.
