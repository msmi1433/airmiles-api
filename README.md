## This project is a work in progress (01/11/2023)

# Air Miles API

This project will provide an API for a future website, focussed on enabling users to unlock the accrued potential of their air miles/points.

The API interacts with a database that holds information regarding how many air miles/points are required to travel to all destinations served by British Airways from London, in multiple classes of travel.

### Future

Once the API is complete, I will be building a frontend that allows users to enter the amount of air miles/points they have, and see a recommended list of places they can travel to using their points.

The frontend will also contain a chatbot that gives users tips on how to best secure reward/air miles seats with airlines, and an accounts feature that allows users to track their progress towards a points goal for a given trip.

I plan to add more airlines to the database once the frontend for this project has been released.
